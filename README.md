# CREATING-SSIS-SSRS-REPORTS

Here I have worked on dataset of CRIME from Montgomery county. The reason for selecting this dataset was to get a better business vision like how we can keep a record of specific crimes happening in specific areas and how it can help in future to minimize those crimes. First of all we created a star schema in DRAW.io according to dataset .Then we implemented SSIS tool to insert data into tables as per our requirements to create dimension table and fact table according to our star schema. We also assigned the primary key to all the dimensions as needed.
After successful completion of creating tables in SSIS we moved forward to SSRS which is a reporting tool in Visual studio. In SSRS we created four reports through which we get to know crimes on the basis of city, on the basis of various offences and many more .For the purpose of visualization in R we used queries created in sql and libraries in R.  We used various charts like Pie chart, Bar graph and other to plot the data for making a good sense to grasp report. Then moving forward to NEO 4J we added csv files in it to get a graphical representation. We can fire Number of queries in real time in NEO 4J. We have also created xml and xsd schema files and validated those successfully .xml files contain the entries from our excel file and xsd schema contains parameters of the data used in xml.
